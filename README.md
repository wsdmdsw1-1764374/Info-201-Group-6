Abstract (Sára)
Our team is interested in exploring the correlation between high school students’ race and their graduation and post-secondary outcomes. As part of the differences that we observe in the educational outcomes among different racial groups Our team also wants to observe how students’ involvement with the criminal justice system affects said educational attainment and how race factors into this.
