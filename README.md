# Final Project Proposal, Group 6

## Abstract
Our team is interested in exploring the correlation between high school students’ race and their graduation and post-secondary outcomes. As part of the differences that we observe in the educational outcomes among different racial groups Our team also wants to observe how students’ involvement with the criminal justice system affects said educational attainment and how race factors into this.

## 1. Introduction  
Research questions:
1. How does race influence educational outcomes for Washington state high schoolers?
2. To what extent does Washington state high schoolers’ involvement with the criminal justice system affect their educational outcomes?
3. How strongly is race correlated to high schoolers’ criminal justice system involvement and high school graduation rates?

Education has always been one of the most concerning topics among the world. It is good to see that the educational attainment of the whole population has increased for the past few years. However, differences and gaps between the races still remain, or even worse, grow. In contemporary society, educational attainment could be one of the vital determinants of a person’s future path. To put it into the specific scenario, a decent education could help the person to have better job opportunities and the possibility to apply for higher wages. Beyond the economic elements, those who fail to graduate from high school are more likely to have health problems, worse housing, unhappy families, etc., compared with those who are “highly educated.”
If a person’s future is highly dependent on his/her educational attainment, and it would be affected by some demographic reasons; In other words, one’s future is determined by his/her ethnicity. The injustice a person will undergo is formed since his/her birth. As a bad consequence, it is undeniable that many situations like this would make people be disappointed and less confident about the meaning of education. Therefore, by focusing on Washington State, we would like to explore how demographic elements affect the educational result for high school students, the level that race is connected to high schoolers’ criminal justice system, and how they influence the educational outcomes when they are combined. Hopefully, it is possible to see if there is anything we can do to alleviate such inequality.

## 2. Related Work

Our team is researching the correlation between high school students’ race, their involvement with the criminal justice system and their educational outcomes to better understand the quantitative data behind sociological research and articles that discuss how punitive policies in K-12 public schools disproportionately affect students of color. *Police and punitive policies make schools less safe, especially for minority students*, an article written by Washington Post journalist  Kathryn Schumaker, discusses how especially
> “Black students [and students of color] are [much more likely to be suspended](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/17/8255), expelled or arrested at school than white students…[mostly for minor infractions](https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/projects/center-for-civil-rights-remedies/school-to-prison-folder/federal-reports/out-of-school-and-off-track-the-overuse-of-suspensions-in-american-middle-and-high-schools) such as disrupting class or tardiness as opposed to criminal or violent behavior.” (Riddle and Sinclair, 2019) (Center for Civil Rights Remedies, 2019)

Research of this nature has developed new terms to define this social phenomena, such as the *school-to-prison pipeline* [(Heitzeg, 2009)](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ870076.pdf). In her article Education Or Incarceration: Zero Tolerance Policies And The School To Prison Pipeline”, St. Catherine University professor Nancy A. Heitzeg defines the *school-to-prison pipeline* as a “growing pattern of tracking students out of educational institutions, primarily via ―zero tolerance policies, and tracking them directly and/or indirectly into the juvenile and adult criminal justice systems.”

The *school-to-prison pipeline* disproportionately affects marginalized communities such as low-income youth, students with disabilities, and youth of color, especially Black students. Black students are suspended and expelled at the highest rates, despite the lack of evidence to prove that Black students are more likely to misbehave under the same circumstances as their counterparts [(Witt, 2007)](https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-070924discipline-story.html).
